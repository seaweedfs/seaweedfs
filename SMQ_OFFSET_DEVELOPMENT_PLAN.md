# SMQ Native Offset Development Plan

## Overview

Add native per-partition sequential offsets to SeaweedMQ to eliminate the need for external offset mapping and provide better interoperability with message queue protocols.

## Architecture Changes

### Data Model
- Add `offset` field (int64) to each record alongside existing `ts_ns`
- Offset domain: per `schema_pb.Partition` (ring range)
- Offsets are strictly monotonic within a partition
- Leader assigns offsets; followers replicate

### Storage
- Use `_index` as hidden SQL table column for offset storage
- Maintain per-partition offset counters in broker state
- Checkpoint offset state periodically for recovery

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Proto and Data Model Changes

**Scope**: Update protobuf definitions and core data structures

**Tasks**:
1. Update `mq_schema.proto`:
   - Add `offset` field to record storage format
   - Add offset-based `OffsetType` enums
   - Add `offset_value` field to subscription requests
2. Update `mq_agent.proto`:
   - Add `base_offset` and `last_offset` to `PublishRecordResponse`
   - Add `offset` field to `SubscribeRecordResponse`
3. Regenerate protobuf Go code
4. Update core data structures in broker code
5. Add offset field to SQL schema with `_index` column

**Tests**:
- Proto compilation tests
- Data structure serialization tests
- SQL schema migration tests

**Deliverables**:
- Updated proto files
- Generated Go code
- Updated SQL schema
- Basic unit tests

### Phase 2: Offset Assignment Logic

**Scope**: Implement offset assignment in broker

**Tasks**:
1. Add `PartitionOffsetManager` component:
   - Track `next_offset` per partition
   - Assign sequential offsets to records
   - Handle offset recovery on startup
2. Integrate with existing record publishing flow:
   - Assign offsets before storage
   - Update `PublishRecordResponse` with offset info
3. Add offset persistence to storage layer:
   - Store offset alongside record data
   - Index by offset for efficient lookups
4. Implement offset recovery:
   - Load highest offset on partition leadership
   - Handle clean and unclean restarts

**Tests**:
- Offset assignment unit tests
- Offset persistence tests
- Recovery scenario tests

   - Handle out-of-range offset requests gracefully
4. Implement offset-based filtering and pagination

**Tests**:
