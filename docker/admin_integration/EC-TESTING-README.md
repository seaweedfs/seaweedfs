# SeaweedFS EC Worker Testing Environment

This Docker Compose setup provides a comprehensive testing environment for SeaweedFS Erasure Coding (EC) workers using **official SeaweedFS commands**.

## üìÇ Directory Structure

The testing environment is located in `docker/admin_integration/` and includes:

```
docker/admin_integration/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Makefile                     # Main management interface
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ docker-compose-ec-test.yml   # Docker compose configuration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ EC-TESTING-README.md         # This documentation
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ run-ec-test.sh              # Quick start script
```

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The testing environment uses **official SeaweedFS commands** and includes:

- **1 Master Server** (port 9333) - Coordinates the cluster with 50MB volume size limit
- **6 Volume Servers** (ports 8080-8085) - Distributed across 2 data centers and 3 racks for diversity  
- **1 Filer** (port 8888) - Provides file system interface
- **1 Admin Server** (port 23646) - Detects volumes needing EC and manages workers using official `admin` command
- **3 EC Workers** - Execute erasure coding tasks using official `worker` command with task-specific working directories
- **1 Load Generator** - Continuously writes and deletes files using SeaweedFS shell commands
- **1 Monitor** - Tracks cluster health and EC progress using shell scripts

## ‚ú® New Features

### **Task-Specific Working Directories**
Each worker now creates dedicated subdirectories for different task types:
- `/work/erasure_coding/` - For EC encoding tasks
- `/work/vacuum/` - For vacuum cleanup tasks  
- `/work/balance/` - For volume balancing tasks

This provides:
- **Organization**: Each task type gets isolated working space
- **Debugging**: Easy to find files/logs related to specific task types
- **Cleanup**: Can clean up task-specific artifacts easily
- **Concurrent Safety**: Different task types won't interfere with each other's files

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- GNU Make installed
- At least 4GB RAM available for containers
- Ports 8080-8085, 8888, 9333, 23646 available

### Start the Environment

```bash

## üîÑ How EC Testing Works

### 1. Continuous Load Generation
- **Write Rate**: 10 files/second (1-5MB each)
- **Delete Rate**: 2 files/second
- **Target**: Fill volumes to 50MB limit quickly

### 2. Volume Detection
- Admin server scans master every 30 seconds
- Identifies volumes >40MB (80% of 50MB limit)
- Queues EC tasks for eligible volumes

### 3. EC Worker Assignment
- **Worker 1**: EC specialist (max 2 concurrent tasks)
- **Worker 2**: EC + Vacuum hybrid (max 2 concurrent tasks)  
- **Worker 3**: EC + Vacuum hybrid (max 1 concurrent task)

### 4. Comprehensive EC Process
Each EC task follows 6 phases:
1. **Copy Volume Data** (5-15%) - Stream .dat/.idx files locally
2. **Mark Read-Only** (20-25%) - Ensure data consistency
3. **Local Encoding** (30-60%) - Create 14 shards (10+4 Reed-Solomon)
4. **Calculate Placement** (65-70%) - Smart rack-aware distribution
5. **Distribute Shards** (75-90%) - Upload to optimal servers
6. **Verify & Cleanup** (95-100%) - Validate and clean temporary files

### 5. Real-Time Monitoring
- Volume analysis and EC candidate detection
- Worker health and task progress
- No data loss verification
- Performance metrics

make start

# Watch progress
make monitor-status

# Check for EC candidates
make volume-status

# View worker activity
make logs-workers

# Stop when done
make stop
```

### High-Load Testing

# Start with higher load
make dev-start

# Scale up workers and load
make scale-workers WORKERS=5
make scale-load RATE=50

# Monitor intensive EC activity
make logs-admin
```

### Debugging Issues
```bash
# Check port conflicts and system state
make troubleshoot

# View specific service logs
make logs-admin
make logs-worker1

# Get shell access for debugging
make shell-admin
make shell-worker1

# Check detailed status
make debug
```

### Development Iteration
```bash
# Quick restart after code changes
make restart

# Rebuild and restart
make clean
make start

# Monitor specific components
make logs-monitor
```

## üìà Expected Results

### Successful EC Testing Shows:
1. **Volume Growth**: Steady increase in volume sizes toward 50MB limit
2. **EC Detection**: Admin server identifies volumes >40MB for EC
3. **Task Assignment**: Workers receive and execute EC tasks
4. **Shard Distribution**: 14 shards distributed across 6 volume servers
5. **No Data Loss**: All files remain accessible during and after EC
6. **Performance**: EC tasks complete within estimated timeframes

### Sample Monitor Output:
```bash
# Check current status
make monitor-status

# Output example:
{
  "monitor": {
    "uptime": "15m30s",
    "master_addr": "master:9333",
    "admin_addr": "admin:9900"
  },
  "stats": {
    "VolumeCount": 12,
    "ECTasksDetected": 3,
    "WorkersActive": 3
  }
}
```

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables

You can customize the environment by setting variables:

```bash
# High load testing
WRITE_RATE=25 DELETE_RATE=5 make start

# Extended test duration
TEST_DURATION=7200 make start  # 2 hours
```

### Scaling Examples

```bash
# Scale workers
make scale-workers WORKERS=6

# Increase load generation
make scale-load RATE=30

# Combined scaling
make scale-workers WORKERS=4
make scale-load RATE=40
```

## üßπ Cleanup Options

```bash
# Stop services only
make stop

# Remove containers but keep volumes
make down

# Remove data volumes only
make clean-volumes

# Remove built images only
make clean-images

# Complete cleanup (everything)
make clean
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Quick Diagnostics
```bash
# Run complete troubleshooting
make troubleshoot

# Check specific components
make health
make debug
make status
```

### Common Issues

**Services not starting:**
```bash
# Check port availability
make troubleshoot

# View startup logs
make logs-master
make logs-admin
```

**No EC tasks being created:**
```bash
# Check volume status
make volume-status

# Increase load to fill volumes faster
make scale-load RATE=30

# Check admin detection
make logs-admin
```

**Workers not responding:**
```bash
# Check worker registration
make admin-status

# View worker logs
make logs-workers

# Restart workers
make restart
```

### Performance Tuning

**For faster testing:**
```bash
make dev-start           # Higher default load
make scale-load RATE=50  # Very high load
```

**For stress testing:**
```bash
make scale-workers WORKERS=8
make scale-load RATE=100
```
