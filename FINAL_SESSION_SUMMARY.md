# Schema Registry Integration - Final Session Summary

## Total Commits: 27

## Bugs Fixed:

### 1. ✓ Subscriber Session Caching Bug
**Commits**: 25530b46b, ab0e428d2  
**Problem**: `GetOrCreateSubscriber` cached sessions, returning stale data when same offset requested twice  
**Solution**: Implemented `CreateFreshSubscriber` to create new uncached session per fetch

### 2. ✓ Init Response Consumption Bug  
**Commit**: 767cf3e4f  
**Problem**: CreateFreshSubscriber called `Recv()` to get init response, but broker sends first data record AS init response, causing 30s timeout on subsequent `Recv()` in ReadRecords  
**Solution**: Don't call `Recv()` in CreateFreshSubscriber, let ReadRecords handle all receives

### 3. ✓ System Topic Processing Bug
**Commit**: a56107466  
**Problem**: `decodeRecordValueToKafkaMessage` was treating system topics (_schemas) as RecordValue protobuf, losing data  
**Solution**: Return raw bytes for system topics without RecordValue processing

## Current Status:

### Working Components:
- ✓ Consumer offset management (in-memory + filer storage)
- ✓ OffsetCommit/OffsetFetch protocol handlers
- ✓ Fresh subscriber creation (no caching)
- ✓ Fetch timeout fixed (no init response consumption)
- ✓ System topic raw byte handling

### Remaining Issues:

**Data Integrity After Restart**:
- Filer lookup errors: "failed to locate 8,0262617b54"
- Indicates chunk/metadata corruption after service restart
- All values showing as empty despite broker having correct data
- Likely a filer persistence or volume state issue

**Root Cause Theory**:
1. Data IS written correctly (broker logs confirm 511/111 byte values)
2. Data IS stored in filer (broker can read it initially)
3. After restart, filer chunk lookups fail
4. Result: Empty values returned to Gateway

## Test Results:

**Before Fixes**:
- Schemas: 10/10 registered, 0/10 verified
- Error: 30s fetch timeouts
- Error: All values empty (stale session cache)

**After Session Cache Fix**:
- Schemas: 10/10 registered, 0/10 verified  
- Error: 30s fetch timeouts (init response bug)

**After Init Response Fix**:
- No more 30s timeouts ✓
- Fresh start: data flows correctly
- After restart: filer lookup failures

## Recommendations:

1. **Immediate**: Fix filer chunk persistence/lookup after restart
   - Investigate filer extended attributes for offset metadata
   - Check volume/filer state consistency after restart
   - Review chunk garbage collection timing

2. **Architecture**: Consider simplified subscriber model
   - Current: Fresh subscriber per fetch (correct but heavy)
   - Alternative: Reuse sessions but track current offset position
   - Or: Broker includes offset in SubscribeMessageResponse

3. **Testing**: Add integration tests for restart scenarios
   - Write data → restart services → verify data still readable
   - Test offset continuity across restarts

## Files Modified:
- `weed/mq/kafka/consumer_offset/*.go` - Offset storage
- `weed/mq/kafka/protocol/handler.go` - Offset integration
- `weed/mq/kafka/protocol/fetch.go` - System topic handling
- `weed/mq/kafka/integration/seaweedmq_handler.go` - Fresh subscriber
- `weed/mq/broker/broker_grpc_sub.go` - Debug logging

## Key Learnings:

1. Subscriber session lifecycle is critical - stale sessions cause data loss
2. gRPC stream init responses can contain data - don't consume blindly  
3. System topics need special handling - no protobuf processing
4. Data persistence across restarts needs robust testing
5. Debug logging at each layer is essential for distributed systems

## Next Steps:

1. Investigate and fix filer chunk lookup failures after restart
2. Test with fresh storage (clean volumes)
